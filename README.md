IPL is a season sport of T20-cricket which is usually played in the summer break.

Great chcunks of money is invested in both the local and overseas player to strenghten their teams.

So for this investment to be done requires a lot of data to be looked upon starting from strike rate to average to death bowling to mention a few.

We can get lot of insights through the Exploartion of the IPL Dataset which was crawled and is available in kaggle.
Thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020.

We have two datasets to work on :
* Matches datset
* Bowler's Dataset

Both of these datasets were used to infer the insights:

Coming to few of the exploration that was done on the data are

most man of the match awards
A player distribution of runs 
Player who has cored maximum number of runs in boundaries
Team who have scored most runs in boundaries
Toss level data 
Bowlers economy in death overs
Best and worst team on defending and chasing

There are other analysis is also done which are suffixed with proper text and are avilable in the ipython notebook.

Also various plots are shown using the matplotlib library to visualize the data better and conclude well on the output.
